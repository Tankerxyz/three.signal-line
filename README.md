# !Archived! because the author didn't find any good reasons for publishing this library.
You can see what the author wanted to publish as a library in this [demo](https://j36nl7zoow.csb.app/).

Yes, it's beautiful, but not needed for the open-source community.

# Features

* Write **standard, future javascript** – with stable ESNext features – today ([stage 3](https://github.com/tc39/proposals) or [finished](https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/finished-proposals.md) features)
* [Optionally use typescript](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/its-time-to-give-typescript-another-chance-2caaf7fabe61) to improve tooling, linting, and documentation generation
* Export as a [javascript module](http://jsmodules.io/), making your work **fully tree-shakable** for consumers capable of using [es6 imports](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/pkg.module) (like [Rollup](http://rollupjs.org/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), or [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/))
* Export type declarations to improve your downstream development experience
* Backwards compatibility for Node.js-style (CommonJS) imports
* Both strict and flexible [typescript configurations](config/tsconfig.json) available

So we can have nice things:

* Generate API documentation (HTML or JSON) [without a mess of JSDoc tags](https://blog.cloudflare.com/generating-documentation-for-typescript-projects/) to maintain
* Collocated, atomic, concurrent unit tests with [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava)
* Source-mapped code coverage reports with [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc)
* Configurable code coverage testing (for continuous integration)
* Automatic linting and formatting using [TSLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
* Automatically check for known vulnerabilities in your dependencies with [`nsp`](https://github.com/nodesecurity/nsp)
